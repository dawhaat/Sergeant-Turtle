          <p>
            <slth>Slytherin</slth> is one of <hgw>the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</hgw>,
            founded
            by <slth>Salazar Slytherin</slth>.
            In establishing the house, <slth>Salazar</slth> instructed <hgw>the Sorting Hat</hgw> to pick students who
            had a few particular characteristics he most valued.
            Those characteristics include <slth>cunning</slth>, <slth>resourcefulness</slth>, <slth>leadership</slth>,
            <slth>ambition</slth> and <slth>self-preservation</slth>.
            Many <slth>Slytherin</slth> students tend to clique together, often acquiring leaders,
            which further exemplifies <slth>Slytherin's</slth> ambitious qualities.
            <br>
            Another characteristic some <slth>Slytherins</slth> share is a tendency towards deep, unrequited love.
            <slth>The Bloody Baron</slth> held abiding but unreturned feelings for <rvnclw>Helena Ravenclaw</rvnclw>.
            <br>
            <slth>The founder</slth> highly valued and favoured <slth>Pure-blood</slth> students and <hgw>the Sorting Hat
            </hgw> admitted that it can be a factor when being sorted.
            Students of any blood status can be placed in <hgw>the house</hgw>. However, a Muggle-Born student from that
            <hgw>house</hgw> is considered to be quite rare.

          <p>
            <slth>The emblematic animal</slth> of <hgw>the house</hgw> is <slth>a snake</slth> and the house's colors are <slth>green and silver</slth>.
            <slth>Slytherin</slth> corresponds roughly with the element of water due to <slth>serpents</slth> being commonly associated
            with the sea and lochs in Western European mythology, as well as <slth>serpents</slth> being physically fluid 
            and flexible animals. Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world,
            leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many <slth>Slytherins'</slth> hope for a
            <slth>pure-blood only</slth> community. The colors also correspond with waters around lakes and lochs often
            being <slth>green</slth> and <slth>silver</slth> often associated with grey rainwater<hgw1>.</hgw1>

          <p>
            There're two correct answers. First is <slth>Slytherin</slth> is in our hearts and the second
            is <slth>The Slytherin Common Room</slth> is located near <hgw>the dungeons</hgw> and can be found by following the
            signs at the bottom of <hgw>The Grand Staircase</hgw>.
            Walk down a couple flights of stairs turning right and you should see <slth>Slytherin Banners</slth> to your left.

          <h1 class="history" id="history">History</h1>
          <p>
            <slth>Slytherin's</slth> opposition over the idea to allow <hgw>witches and wizards</hgw> from Half-blood
            and Muggle-born heritage
            to enrol at <hgw>Hogwarts</hgw> during its foundation created great controversy at <hgw>the school</hgw> and
            it was the root of a feud between former friends <slth>Slytherin</slth> and <gryf>Godric Gryffindor</gryf>.
            <br>
            <slth>Slytherin</slth> later decided to leave <hgw>the school</hgw> when an argument started between <slth> him </slth> and <gryf>Gryffindor</gryf>,
            and they either duelled or started a civil war between <hgw>the two houses</hgw>.
            Such an argument would be forever known as the origin of the feud between their <hgw>two houses</hgw> and also made them <hgw>the houses</hgw> that are most competitive.
            <br>
            When <slth>Slytherin</slth> departed <hgw>Hogwarts</hgw>, he would leave behind <slth>the Chamber of Secrets</slth> with the purpose of
            <slth>an heir</slth> opening <slth>the chamber</slth> one day and unleashing a means of purging
            <hgw>the school</hgw> of those who, in his view, were unworthy to study <hgw>magic</hgw>: Muggle-borns.
